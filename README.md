# Engutoto Smart River Monitoring System (ESRMS)

The Engutoto Smart River Monitoring System is designed to monitor water quality in the Engutoto River using Arduino sensors. It captures data such as pH level, turbidity, and temperature, helping the community and local authorities take timely actions.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- pH Sensor
- Turbidity Sensor
- Temperature Sensor (LM35 or similar)
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires
- Power Supply

## How It Works
- The sensors collect data from the river.
- Arduino processes and sends the data via Serial Monitor or GSM/Wi-Fi module (optional).
- Data can be sent to a cloud service or used in a mobile/web dashboard.

## Uploading the Code
1. Open `river_monitoring.ino` in Arduino IDE.
2. Connect your Arduino Uno board.
3. Select correct board and port.
4. Click Upload.
